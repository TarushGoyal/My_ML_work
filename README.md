MY MACHINE LEARNING WORK:
this repository contains two of the models my colleage Pranav Goyal and I i.e. Tarush Goyal created for 'Churn' Analysis at Vedantu as a part of our Summer Internship 2019.

NeuralNetwork.py and SequenceModel.py as simple neural network and sequence model codes.
The Dense_Sequence_model.py file is a network in which the input is a set of sequences. These sequences are dealt with using RNNs with LSTMs The single outputs for each sequence type is then passed through a simple Neural Network with Dense Connections.
